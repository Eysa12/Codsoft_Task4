# 📊 Sales Prediction Using Python
📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting product sales based on historical sales data. Using machine learning techniques, the model helps in forecasting future sales, which can assist businesses in making better decisions regarding inventory, marketing, and strategy.

🚀 Objectives

Load and preprocess the sales dataset
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Apply feature engineering techniques
Train regression models to predict sales
Evaluate model performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² score
